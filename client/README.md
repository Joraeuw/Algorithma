# Algorithma

Web application was created with the purpose of supporting informatics education and the learning of algorithms by visualizing a wide range of algorithms in an incredibly beautiful and clear manner. Build with React, Redux, JavaScript, TailWindCSS, WebPack, PostCSS.

## THIS PROJECT IS STILL EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT
This project is currently very early in development. No feature is fully functional yet!

## Setup instructions
Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

### Installation: 

`npm install`  

### To run in development:

`npm run dev`

### To visit semi-developed part of the project, go to:

`http://localhost:3000/graphs/`

## Reflection
This is looking to be a yearlong project started on October 2021. The main goal of this project is to make algorithms of all sorts well understood from people of varying ages and development areas. This project has been, and still is an incredible introduction to web development for me.

Originally the idea was to build an application like Khan Academy that helps youths learn programming, but then I broadened my project to allow the learning of algorithms that will be of help to individuals from complete beginners to well-established software developers.

## Future versions will include:
- [ ] A well-established frontend with fully functional algorithms and visualization.
- [ ] A backend server to handle users and save progress. Will likely include:
  - Redis
  - NodeJS
  - Express.js
  - MySQL or MongoDB
