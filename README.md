# Algorithma

The web application was created with the purpose of supporting informatics education and the learning of algorithms by visualizing a wide range of algorithms in an incredibly beautiful and clear manner. Build with React, Redux, JavaScript, TailWindCSS, WebPack, PostCSS.

## THIS PROJECT IS STILL EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT

This project is currently very early in development. No feature is fully functional yet!

## Setup instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

### Installation:

`npm install`

### To run in development:

`npm run dev`

### To visit semi-developed part of the project, go to:

`http://localhost:3000/graphs/`

## Reflection

This is expected to be a yearlong project started in October 2021. The main goal of this project is to make algorithms of all sorts well understood from people of varying ages and experience levels. This project has been, and still is an incredible introduction to web development for me.

Originally the idea was to build an application like Khan Academy that helps youths learn programming, but then I broadened my project to allow the learning of algorithms that will be helpful to individuals from complete beginners to well-established software developers.

## Future versions will include:

- [ ] A coplete frontend with fully functional algorithms and visualizations.
- [ ] A backend server to handle users and save progress. Will likely include:
  - Redis
  - NodeJS
  - Express.js
  - MySQL or MongoDB
